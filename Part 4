What could possibly be done to improve correct spelling is run through token and the correct word it is being compared to
and check each character for the best matched words. Since the spelling may be a little complicated in terms of where 
exactly the issue is and how many misspelled instances there is, it could compare the values of how often it is used and then make the deduction there. 
We could also use a hashtable to store most used words in order to be better at suggesting correct words. Possibly substituting the assumed wrong characters 
in the word as we run through it in order to come to closest word possible in order to better improve results.
